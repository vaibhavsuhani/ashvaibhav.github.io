                            <p>
                                Roli - the cutest and liveliest girl I have ever met. Sharp memory, loud laughter, beautiful honest eyes and as talkative as me. I love her eyes - bright and a window to her beautiful soul. I love the fact that she is one whom I can fully trust and understands me better than most. She is great at managing things and she loves to create things (art and craft).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                She can be quite daunting if she gets irritated, but even in her anger she appears to be so cute and lovely. Its been fun skyping, messaging texts, facetiming, orkutting, with her. It was easy to cut off communication with one another when angry. It would be fun to see how we cut each other now when we live together. I promise to keep irritating her for our entire lives.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                She gets irritated when she is talking about something serious and I am in the mood of fun. Of course she loves to continue to be in her fun mood when I am doing something serious. Plus we are ones of complete opposite tastes. She loves pizza and I love pineapple - complete opposites. But we find something fitting for both of us like pineapple pizza. I love you.

                            <h2>VAIBHAV</h2>
                            <p>
                                <img src="img/pics/editing/vaibhavThumb.png" class="thumb" alt="Vaibhav" />
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Vaibhav is the most genuine person I have ever met with but only when you get to know the “Real” him. The first thing I liked in him was his smile, it made me smile and it still does.

                                He is my anchor in life and supported me through the toughest times. I never knew 9 years ago that he will be the one. Eventually he did become my Mr Perfect.

                                <br>
                                3 things which most of the people don’t know about him:
                                <ul>
                                <li>            He sings well, only if he can remember the lyrics of the songs. The first song he sung to me was “Goli maaro bheje mein" </li>
                                <li>            The first thing he notices in a girl is her nails. He hate big nails and nail polish all the more. </li>
                                <li>            He can turn any song into a personalised customised “Rolu” song in seconds.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>He is one crazy guy with whom I keep falling in love again and again and would love to keep falling for the rest of my life.</p>

                            <h2>HOW WE MET</h2>
                            <p>
                                In June 2006, the two of us met on Orkut in the virtual world. Later in October we met for the first time in Thomso - the IIT Roorkee annual fest. And since then the romance has always been in air. 
                                It has always been a long distance relationship, communicating through miss calls, messages, emails, and social networks, always trying to find “saste jugaad” during college.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We got committed (June 2007) while both of us were in different continents. Suhani, in Roorkee enjoying her summer vacations and writing long emails and messages. Vaibhav, in UK enjoying vacation with his father and BigB and hacking library computer to reply to those emails and giving miss calls in reply to messages. The proposal as well happened through a sms and few miss calls.

                            <h2>THE ENGAGEMENT</h2>
                            <p>Our long distance relationship had its own disadvantages. Ours wasn’t a surprise ring popping engagement. During Suhani’s visit to SFO, one fine morning Vaibhav informed he had a surprise. He looked around for something and finally came up with a big envelope. It was the sizing scale he had ordered to take my ring’s size. SURPRISE!!! </p>

                            <p>On the last day, we got a ring made (we both chose it) and decided to get engaged at the Golden Gate Bridge. We drove to the Golden Gate Bridge but couldn’t find the spot Vaibhav had identified for proposing officially. As we were getting late to catch Suhani's flight to Washington, we didn’t have much time to look around. We were driving to the airport and then suddenly Vaibhav suggested to show me the Crooked Street. We reached there and while we were getting down, Vaibhav stopped the car in the middle and asked me to take out the ring and proposed “Marry me or I’ll release the break” and of course I “had” to say “YES”!!! </p>
